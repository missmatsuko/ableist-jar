<h1 id="ableistjar">The Ableist Jar</h1>

<h2 id="whatisthis">What is this?</h2>

<p>A bit like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swear_jar">swear jar</a>, the Ableist Jar aims to help discourage people from using ableist language.</p>

<p>You get &#8220;fined&#8221; every time you use an ableist word. You can self-monitor your own vocabulary, although that can be difficult when you&#8217;re not quite self-aware of the words you use. Or others may gently remind you that you&#8217;re using ableist language. </p>

<h2 id="ableistlanguage">Ableist language</h2>

<p>Ableist language is using words or phrases that have a negative impact or connotation on or for people with disabilities. The person using ableist language does not usually mean to have a negative impact, but the effect is there nonetheless. Language has power. </p>

<p>These words typically are words that come from a medical or disability context, which have been reused. Some words include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crazy</li>
<li>Insane</li>
<li><a href="https://incl.ca/why-i-do-not-like-the-word-lame/">Lame</a></li>
<li><a href="https://incl.ca/wheelchair-bound-i-dont-think-so/">Wheelchair bound</a></li>
<li>Retard</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</h2>

<p>It works on the honour system. When you notice you&#8217;ve used an ableist word, or when someone points it out to you, you can make a $1 donation to the &#8220;jar&#8221;. Or you can build yourself a tab and come in once a week or a month to put in your jar&#8217;s fund as a donation.</p>

<p>We are working on establishing the logistics of sending money to the non-profit. Stay tuned, this should work in the next few days.</p>

<h2 id="charitybenefiting">Charity benefiting</h2>

<p>We are channeling all donations to the <a href="https://osmihelp.org/">OSMI - Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a>. This is a non-profit working in the tech/open source sector focusing on mental health issues. As a lot of the ableist language in the tech sector revolves around mental health, it seems fitting to send the proceeds of the Ableist Jar to them.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>This site is an idea by <a href="https://incl.ca">Nicolas Steenhout</a>, a long time disability rights activist who has encouraged many people in the tech industry to stop using ableist language. The idea came to life after a throwaway tweet that received a lot of interest.</p>
